The project description: 

1. Pandai Sdn Bhd runs a number of tuition centers throughout KL and JB. Depending on business conditions, they are looking continually to open new centers and from time to time, they may have to close existing ones.  
 
Each tuition center, situated in a physical address and headed by a HeadMaster, employs a number of tutors to handle batches of students (they take in a new batch each year). Tutors are all freelancers; they come and go throughout the year, and each student is assigned to one tutor. Each center maintains the data for each tutor (name, IC,  address, qualification, # yearexp, date joined, # years in the center etc) and each student (name, IC, address, year, schoolname, list of scores, etc). 
Pandai Sdn Bhd from time to time needs report on the performance of each center - #students, #tutors, avg marks, min, max,  tutors background, etc.
